# Automatic-University-Classroom-Allocation-System-

In many universities, classroom allocation is still managed manually or through semi
automated processes that are inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming. As the number of 
students, courses, and faculty increases, administrators are faced with the challenge of 
ensuring that classrooms are properly assigned based on availability, room capacity, professor 
schedules, and student group conflicts. Overlapping class timings, underutilized classrooms, 
and last-minute changes further complicate the task. 

There is a critical need for a system that can streamline the allocation process by automatically 
assigning classrooms to courses while satisfying a range of academic and logistical 
constraints. At the same time, the system must offer flexibility by allowing manual 
adjustments when unique scheduling requirements arise. The lack of such a comprehensive 
solution often results in administrative delays, student dissatisfaction, and inefficient use of 
institutional resources. 

This project addresses these challenges by developing a web-based classroom allocation 
system that combines the power of automated scheduling with the adaptability of manual 
input. The goal is to enhance accuracy, improve classroom utilization, and reduce the 
workload of academic staff involved in timetable planning.
